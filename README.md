# Brain Tumour MRI Classification Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project applies deep learning techniques to classify brain tumour types using MRI images. The goal is to support early diagnosis and improve treatment planning accuracy.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)
- The dataset includes labeled MRI images categorized by tumour type.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle environment)

## My Role (Pallavi Ranganatha)
I was responsible for:
- Model architecture and layer selection
- Implementing the deep learning model in Python using Keras
- Splitting the dataset for training, validation, and testing
- Training the model and monitoring performance

## Team Contributions
- **Snehal Patel**: Research, literature review, dataset selection, poster content (motivation and evaluation)
- **Connor Campbell**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, scaling, exploratory data analysis
- **Pallavi Ranganatha**: Model and layer design, deep learning pipeline implementation
- **Chloe Welford**: Hyperparameter tuning, confusion matrix, accuracy visualization
- **Mills-Nketsiah Ekow**: Poster creation, result analysis, and future work recommendations

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
   jupyter notebook deep-learning-ica-brain-tumour-classification.ipynb
   ⚠️ Note: This project was implemented and tested in a Kaggle Notebook, which includes the GPU backend for deep learning.
