# Brain Tumour MRI Classification Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements deep learning models to classify brain tumour types from MRI images, aiding early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Dataset
We used the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset?select=Training), which contains labeled MRI images for training and testing.

## Team Roles and Contributions

- **Snehal Patel:** Topic research, literature review, dataset selection, and poster content on problem motivation and results evaluation.
- **Connor Campbell:** Data pre-processing, cleaning, dataset scaling, and initial exploratory data analysis.
- **Pallavi Ranganatha:** Model and layer selection, implementation of the deep learning pipeline, dataset splitting (training, validation, testing), and model fitting.
- **Chloe Welford:** Model tuning, hyperparameter adjustments, result generation, and visualization (confusion matrices, accuracy charts).
- **Mills-Nketsiah Ekow:** Poster preparation, result analysis, conclusions, and future work recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
